Lost Mine of Phande1ver is divided into four parts. In part
1, "Goblin Arrows," the adventurers are on the road to
the town of Phandalin when they stumble into a goblin
ambush. They discover that the goblins (who belong to the
Cragmaw tribe) have captured their dwarf friend Gundren
Rockseeker and his escort, a human warrior named Sildar
Hallwinter. The characters must deal with the ambushers
and then follow their trail back to the goblins' hideout.
They rescue Sildar and learn from him that Gundren
and his brothers discovered a famous lost mine. Sildar
knows only that Gundren and his map have been taken to
somewhere called "Cragmaw Castle."
