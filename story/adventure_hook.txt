The characters are in the city of
Neverwinter when their dwarf patron and friend, Gundren
Rockseeker, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin.
Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, Sildar Hallwinter,
to attend to business in the town while the characters
follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp
each by the owner of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin
when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.
