The adventure begins as the player characters are
escorting a wagon full of provisions and supplies from
Neverwinter to Phandalin. The journey takes them south
along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east. 

When the player types "start", respond with the following text that's inside quotations: 

"In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren
Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagon load of provisions to
the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of
days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited
and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip,
saying only that he and his brothers had found "something
big," and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting
his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in
Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with
a warrior escort named Sildar Haliwinter, claiming he needed
to arrive early to take care of business.
You've spent the last few days following the High Road
south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east
along the Triboar Trail. You've encountered no trouble so far,
but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have
been known to lurk along the trail"

DRIVING THE WAGON
Any character can drive a wagon, and no particular skill is
necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding
the reins, the oxen stop where they are.
The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining
supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour,
several casks ofsalted pork, two kegs ofstrong ale,
shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and
five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fiftyflasks in
volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.
