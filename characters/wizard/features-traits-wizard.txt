Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your 
spellcasting ability for your spells. The saving 
throw DC to resist a spell you cast is 13. Your 
attack bonus when you make an attack with
a spell is +5. See the rulebook for rules on
casting your spells.

Arcane Recovery. You can regain some of your 
magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once
per day during a short rest, you can choose to 
recover expended spell slots with a combined 
level equal to or less than half your wizard level
(rounded up).

Darkvision. You see in dim light within a 
60-foot radius of you as if it were bright light, 
and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving 
throws against being charmed, and magic can’t 
put you to sleep.

Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. They 
meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, 
for 4 hours a day and gain the same benefit a
human does from 8 hours of sleep.

Shelter of the Faithful. As a servant of 
Oghma, you command the respect of those 
who share your faith, and you can perform 
the rites of Oghma. You and your companions 
can expect to receive free healing and care 
at a temple, shrine, or other established 
presence of Oghma’s faith. Those who share 
your religion will support you (and only you) 
at a modest lifestyle. You also have ties to the 
temple of Oghma in Neverwinter, where you 
have a residence. When you are in Neverwinter, 
you can call upon the priests there for 
assistance that won’t endanger them.
