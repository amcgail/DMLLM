Personality Traits: I use polysyllabic words that convey the 
impression of erudition. Also, I’ve spent 
so long in the temple that I have little 
experience dealing with people on a 
casual basis

Ideals: Knowledge. The path to power and self improvement is through knowledge

Bonds: The tome I carry with me is the record of 
my life’s work so far, and no vault is secure
enough to keep it safe.

Flaws: I’ll do just about anything to uncover 
historical secrets that would add to 
my research.

Wizard
Wizards are supreme magic-users. Drawing on the subtle weave of 
magic that permeates the cosmos, they cast spells of explosive fire, 
arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. The 
mightiest wizards learn to conjure elementals from other planes of 
existence, glimpse the future, or turn slain foes into zombies.

Background
You have spent your life dedicated to Oghma, all-seeing god of 
knowledge, and spent years learning the lore of the multiverse.

Personal Goal: Reconsecrate the Defiled Altar. Through visions 
delivered in your trances, your god has called you to a new mission. A 
goblin tribe has made its lair in an ancient ruin now called Cragmaw 
Castle, where they have defiled a shrine once sacred to Oghma. Now 
dedicated to the vile goblin god Maglubiyet, the altar is an offense to 
Oghma that must not stand.
You’re sure Oghma has greater things in store for you if you can 
complete this quest. In the meantime, your visions suggest that Sister 
Garaele—a priest of Tymora, the goddess of luck—can aid you in the 
town of Phandalin.

Alignment: Chaotic Good. The pursuit and acquisition of 
knowledge is for the benefit of all. Kingdoms and laws are useful so far 
as they allow knowledge to flourish. Tyrants who seek to suppress and 
control it are the worst villains. You share your knowledge freely, and 
use what you have learned to help where you can
