Personality Traits: My flattery makes those I talk to feel
wonderful and important. Also, I don’t like
to get dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in 
unsuitable accommodations.

Ideals: Responsibility. It’s the duty of a noble 
to protect the common people, not 
bully them

Bonds: My greataxe is a family heirloom, and it’s 
by far my most precious possession.

Flaws: I have a hard time resisting the allure of 
wealth, especially gold. Wealth can help me 
restore my legacy.
