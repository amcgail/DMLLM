Personality Traits: I’m always polite and respectful. Also, I
don’t trust my gut feelings, so I tend to 
wait for others to act

Ideals: Respect. People deserve to be treated with 
dignity and courtesy.

Bonds: I have three cousins—Gundren, Tharden, 
and Nundro Rockseeker—who are my
friends and cherished clan members

Flaws: I secretly wonder whether the gods care 
about mortal affairs at all.
