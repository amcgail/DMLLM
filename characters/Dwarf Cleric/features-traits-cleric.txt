Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your spells. The saving 
throw DC to resist a spell you cast is 13. Your 
attack bonus when you make an attack with
a spell is +5. See the rulebook for rules on
casting your spells.

Disciple of Life. Your healing spells are 
particularly effective. Whenever you restore
hit points to a creature with a spell of 1st level 
or higher, the creature regains additional hit 
points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
Darkvision. You see in dim light within a 
60-foot radius of you as if it were bright light, 
and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on 
saving throws against poison, and you have 
resistance against poison damage.

Dwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum 
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time 
you gain a level (included).

Mercenary Sergeant. You were a minor officer
among the Mintarn mercenaries, a position 
that still gets you some perks. Even though
you’re not on active duty, Mintarn soldiers 
recognize your authority and influence, and
they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You
can requisition simple equipment and horses 
for temporary use. You can also gain access 
to Mintarn mercenary encampments and 
fortresses
