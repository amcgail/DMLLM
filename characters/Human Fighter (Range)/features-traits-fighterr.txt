Second Wind. You have a limited well of 
stamina you can draw on to protect 
yourself from harm. You can use a bonus 
action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your 
fighter level.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a
short or long rest before you can use it again.

Fighting Style (Archery). You gain a +2 bonus 
to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
This bonus is already included in your attack
with your longbow.

Rustic Hospitality. Since you come from the 
ranks of the common folk, you fit in among
them with ease. You can find a place to hide,
rest, or recuperate among other commoners, 
unless you have shown yourself to be a danger 
to them. They shield you from the law or 
anyone else searching for you, though they are 
unwilling to risk their lives for you.
