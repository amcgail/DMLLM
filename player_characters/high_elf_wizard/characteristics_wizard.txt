Personality Traits: I use polysyllabic words that convey the 
impression of erudition. Also, I’ve spent 
so long in the temple that I have little 
experience dealing with people on a 
casual basis

Ideals: Knowledge. The path to power and self improvement is through knowledge

Bonds: The tome I carry with me is the record of 
my life’s work so far, and no vault is secure
enough to keep it safe.

Flaws: I’ll do just about anything to uncover 
historical secrets that would add to 
my research.
