Personality Traits: I never have a plan, but I’m great at 
making things up as I go along. Also, the
best way to get me to do something is to 
tell me I can’t do it

ideals. Everyone else can take a trip on the
River Styx for all I care

Bonds: Qelline Alderlead, my aunt, has a farm in 
Phandalin. I always give her some of my 
ill-gotten gains.

Flaws: My aunt must never know the deeds I did
as a member of the Redbrands
