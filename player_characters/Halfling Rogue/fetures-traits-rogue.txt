Thieves’ Cant. You know thieves’ cant, a
secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that 
allows you to hide messages in seemingly 
normal conversation. You also understand a 
set of secret signs and symbols used to convey 
short, simple messages, such as whether an area 
is dangerous, whether loot is nearby, or whether 
the people in an area are easy marks or will
provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

Lucky. When you roll a natural 1 on an attack
roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can
reroll the die and must use the new roll.

Brave. You have advantage on saving throws 
against being frightened.

Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through 
the space of any creature that is of a size larger
than yours.

Naturally Stealthy. You can attempt to hide 
when you are obscured by a creature that is at 
least one size larger than you.

Criminal Contact. You have a contact who 
acts as your liaison to a network of other
criminals. You know how to get messages
to and from your contact, even over great 
distances; you know the local messengers,
corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors 
who can carry messages for you. You can move 
secret information or stolen goods through 
your contact in exchange for money or other 
information you seek
